# Check Hacker News

This add-on is designed to check [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news), if the current webpage has already been submitted. 

- If it has been, you can directly get a link to the discussion. 

- If not, it checks for the website at a whole. It might not make sense for many cases. (eg: github,medium...)

- If it has indeed not been submitted, it also offers a direct link to submit it to HN. 


## Warnings

This has been put together in a few hours, mostly for personnal use. It is more than probable that things might break, (or already are) and that the code will hurt your eyes. It might even be a safety risk, as all the ***innerHTML*** has note been sanitized...
Use at your own risk.
